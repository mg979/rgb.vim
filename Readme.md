## rgb.vim

A (somewhat) minimal colorscheme that uses only three colours (red, green,
blue).

Also working on 256-colours terminals. Made with
[vim-colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate).

- no color for identifiers
- dark mode: green keywords, bold green types, red strings, blue constants
- light mode: blue keywords, bold blue types, red strings, green constants

Light variant is inspired by [ved editor](https://github.com/vlang/ved), with
the addition of the green colour (absent there).

Comes with themes for
[vim-visual-multi](https://github.com/mg979/vim-visual-multi) and
[vim-xtabline](https://github.com/mg979/vim-xtabline) (only applied if you have
them installed, of course).
